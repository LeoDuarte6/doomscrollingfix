## Short Description (132 chars max)
Stop doomscrolling with a breathing pause + intention prompt. Free, private, research-backed. Works on Twitter, Reddit, TikTok & more.

## Detailed Description

**DoomScrollingFix** interrupts autopilot scrolling with a moment of calm — so you decide what to do next, not the algorithm.

### How it works
When you visit a monitored site (Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Facebook), DoomScrollingFix shows:

1. **A 6-second breathing pause** — engages your prefrontal cortex and breaks the scroll reflex
2. **An intention prompt** — "What are you looking for?" Forces you to name a reason
3. **A choice** — go back or continue. No locks, no guilt

After your set time limit, the cycle repeats — catching the moments you don't catch yourself.

### Why it works
- Based on the PNAS "One Sec" study: a single moment of friction reduced social media use by 57%
- Uses implementation intentions (effect size d = 0.65) — naming your goal makes you follow through
- Greyscale mode makes content less stimulating after you continue

### Features
✅ Works on Twitter/X, Reddit, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Facebook
✅ Add any website you want to monitor
✅ Customizable reprompt timer (1-60 minutes)
✅ Dashboard with usage stats and intention history
✅ Greyscale mode reduces visual stimulation
✅ 100% private — no account, no cloud, no tracking
